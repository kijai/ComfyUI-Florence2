This update introduces a specialized Florence-2 model variant designed to significantly enhance the accuracy of dataset captioning, particularly for content that may be perceived as NSFW.

## Key Enhancement: Accurate Dataset Captioning (NSFW Variant)

This new Florence-2 model provides improved precision in generating image captions by directly addressing the issue of hallucinating details, such as clothing, where none or very little is present. While maintaining essential guardrails, this model ensures more accurate and truthful descriptions. This capability is crucial for creating higher-quality datasets, leading to more accurate and reliable downstream applications.

## Essential Technical Adjustment: Davit Configuration Fix and Folder Management

For optimal performance and correct functionality, this specialized Florence-2 model requires a specific configuration change within its `config.json` file. It is essential that the `vision_config.model_type` parameter is explicitly set to `davit`.

To safeguard this critical local modification to the model's settings and prevent it from being inadvertently overwritten by subsequent downloads or updates from the original Hugging Face repository, the downloaded model folder is automatically renamed. This ensures the stability of your locally fixed model, allowing it to integrate seamlessly without risking the loss of vital configuration changes.

## Seamless Integration

This enhancement has been thoughtfully integrated into the existing repository. All original nodes, functions, and workflows remain entirely unchanged and fully functional. The new NSFW-optimized Florence-2 model fits seamlessly into the current structure, extending its capabilities while preserving all pre-existing functionalities.
